The creation is book markable too. \r\n\r\nIn a more complex way, the physics engine behind is able to compute a lots of  interesting value like the relative cross section which give to this library a real interest no only for beginners but also for physicists. \r\n\r\n###  Origin \r\n\r\nThe FGJL is at the origin a part of the Standard Model Project. This project is born during the [CERN Webfest ](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/cern-webfest/) which is an incredible weekend of creativity, friendship and learning.\r\n\r\n![CERN WebFest Logo By CCC](http://www.citizencyberscience.net/cern-webfest/CCC-Cern-WebFest-Logo.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugs,Suggestions ? \r\n\r\nExpress yourself ! \r\nOnly one link : [Bugs and Suggestions](http://px9e.dyndns.org/redmineCern/projects/fgjl/issues/new)","tagline":"FeynmanGraph Javascript library FGJ","note":"Don't delete this file!
